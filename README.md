URF Champion Picker
===================

Urf Champion Picker is a project made for the Riot Games API Challenge 2015. You can see a demo here: http://urfpicker.cloudapp.net/

----------


##Tech
URF champion picker uses the following  open source frameworks to work propperly:

 - [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
 - [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 - [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

##Installation
####Prerequisites
- Ruby v2.1.5 (You can use RVM)
- NodeJs (Or some other javascript runtime)
- Postgres Database

####Get the project
Use the following command to download the project
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:javier-delgado/URF-picker.git
```
####Install dependencies
Move to the root directory and execute the following command:
```sh
$ bundle install
```
> **Note:**

> - If you have RVM installed, a gemset will be created automatically

####Setup secrets.yml
You have to create a secrets.yml file under 'config' folder. Head over [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/) to get a Riot Games API key. To get a randomly generated secret key base just run the following command:
```sh
$ rake secret
```
You can use the file secrets.yml.sample as a reference.
####Setup database.yml
This project uses Postgres as a database Engine, you need to create a database.yml file unde 'config' folder. User database.yml.sample as a reference.

After you have configured this file run the following commands:
```sh
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:schema:load
$ rake db:seed
```
This will create the database with some data (Champions and some other)
####Getting URF matches data
The application has an automated task to fetch URF matches data periodically, BUT this won't work after April 17th, 2015 because the endpoint for URF matches in the Riot Games API will be closed.

Instead you can download a pre-populated database from [here]() and then import it with the following command:
```sh
$ psql -U [dbuser] -d db_urfpicker -f [the_file_you_downloaded]
```
####Finish
That should be it, run "rails server" to get the app running, and try it in your browser http://localhost:3000
